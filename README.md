# Probabilistic-Maze-Runner
An undirected graph of 50 nodes contains three entities - the agent, the prey, and the predator. The agent
must catch the prey before the predator catches the agent. These three entities move in the graph until the
game ends. There is a complete information environment (where the location of the predator and prey is
known to the agent) and a partial information environment (where the agent is not always sure about the
predator and prey information). \
We build various models (rule-based and probabilistic) to inform our decision-making process and increase our chances of winning the game.
